Gilbert Mapemba (born 26 July 1985) is a Zimbabwean defender (right back). He started his
career at Circle Cement FC (Zimbabwe) from 2003 to 2004.. He also played for
Buymore FC between 2005 and 2007. He then joined CAPS United F.C.  from 2008 to 2011. He then went on to join Moroka Swallows of South Africa
where he signed a three year deal. He was part of the Moroka Swallows team which
finished second on the local Premiership League (season 2011/12) and they went
on to win The MTN8 in 2012. His contract at Moroka Swallows was not renewed
because of the "5 foreign player policy" in the South African Premier Soccer
League as the team wanted to add foreign strikers. So currently he is a free
agent.
